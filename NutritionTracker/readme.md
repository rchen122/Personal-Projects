This is a Nutrition Tracker that can save recipes, daily intake, and output them to a google sheets through the google sheets API. Through this project, I utilized file open/read/write, learned json data files, and implemented API methods. 

To run this program, run the main.py file. the main.py's objective is for the user to select a function to do: Log a food intake, create a new recipe, or list current daily intake. At the last 30 minutes of the day, the program will instead run the function to upload the data into a google sheets and reset the daily_intake.json.
